# 6.2 Serverless Backend

#### Scenario Overview

In this scenario, we'll create a serverless backend using Azure Functions. Azure Functions allow you to run code in response to events without managing infrastructure. We'll guide you through each step to set up an Azure Function App and deploy serverless functions.

#### Steps

1. **Define an Azure Function App**: In your Pulumi code, define an Azure Function App that will host your serverless functions.

   ```typescript
   const functionApp = new azure.appservice.FunctionApp("myFunctionApp", {
       resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,
       appServicePlanId: appServicePlan.id,
       version: "~3",
       storageAccountName: storageAccount.name,
       osType: "Linux",
       runtime: "node",
   });
   ```

2. **Deploy Code for Functions**: Write your serverless functions code and deploy it to the Function App.

3. **Run `pulumi up`**: Execute the `pulumi up` command to create the serverless backend using Azure Functions.

By the end of this scenario, you'll have a working serverless backend running on Azure.

These real-world scenarios will provide you with practical experience in using Pulumi to deploy applications and serverless functions in Azure. 

In the upcoming sections, we'll cover testing, continuous integration, collaboration best practices, and explore advanced topics in Pulumi.
