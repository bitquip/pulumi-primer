# Web Application Deployment

### 6.1 Web Application Deployment

#### Scenario Overview

In this scenario, we'll deploy a simple web application to Azure App Service using Pulumi. Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. We'll guide you through each step, demonstrating how Pulumi simplifies the deployment process.

#### Steps

1. **Define an Azure App Service**: In your Pulumi code, define an Azure App Service to host your web application.

   ```typescript
   const appService = new azure.appservice.AppService("myAppService", {
       resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,
       appServicePlanId: appServicePlan.id,
       siteConfig: {
           alwaysOn: true,
           // Other configurations...
       },
   });
   ```

2. **Configure Application Code**: Add your web application code and configure it to deploy to the App Service.

3. **Run `pulumi up`**: Execute the `pulumi up` command to deploy the web application to Azure.

By the end of this scenario, you'll have a web application running on Azure App Service.
