# Installation and Setup


Setting up Pulumi is straightforward, and you'll be up and running in no time. Pulumi supports multiple programming languages, so you can choose the one you're most comfortable with. In this tutorial, we'll focus on using TypeScript for our examples.

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic understanding of cloud computing concepts.
- Familiarity with a programming language (JavaScript/TypeScript preferred).

**Steps:**
1. [Install Pulumi CLI](#install-pulumi-cli)
2. [Configure Your Cloud Provider](#configure-cloud-provider)
3. [Initialize a New Project](#initialize-new-project)

### 2.1 Install Pulumi CLI <a name="install-pulumi-cli"></a>

To get started, you need to install the Pulumi CLI, which is the command-line interface used to interact with Pulumi.

```bash
npm install -g pulumi
```

### 2.2 Configure Your Cloud Provider <a name="configure-cloud-provider"></a>

Before you start creating resources, you'll need to configure your cloud provider credentials. For example, to configure AWS credentials:

```bash
pulumi login
pulumi config set aws:region us-west-1
pulumi config set aws:accessKey <your-access-key>
pulumi config set aws:secretKey <your-secret-key>
```

### 2.3 Initialize a New Project <a name="initialize-new-project"></a>

Let's create a new directory for your Pulumi project and initialize it.

```bash
mkdir pulumi-tutorial
cd pulumi-tutorial
pulumi new aws-typescript
```

This will guide you through project setup and generate some initial files.

In the next section, we'll create your first Pulumi stack and define some infrastructure using code.
