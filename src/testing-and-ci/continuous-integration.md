# Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is crucial for automating the building, testing, and deployment of your Pulumi infrastructure code. In this section, we'll explore how to set up CI for your Pulumi projects using Azure DevOps Pipelines.

### 8.1 Why Use Continuous Integration?

Continuous Integration provides several advantages for your Pulumi infrastructure code:

- **Automated Testing**: Automatically run tests whenever changes are pushed, ensuring issues are detected early.
- **Consistency**: Ensure all code changes go through the same testing and deployment process.
- **Efficiency**: Reduce manual effort and minimize human errors in deployments.
- **Visibility**: Gain insights into build and test results.

### 8.2 Setting Up CI with Azure DevOps Pipelines

Azure DevOps Pipelines is a CI/CD platform that integrates seamlessly with Azure services. Here's how you can set up CI for your Pulumi project using Azure DevOps Pipelines:

#### 8.2.1 Create a Pipeline

1. Navigate to your Azure DevOps project and select your repository.

2. Click on "Pipelines" in the left sidebar and then click the "New Pipeline" button.

3. Follow the guided setup to create a new pipeline. You'll need to choose your repository, configure your pipeline settings, and choose a template.

#### 8.2.2 Define the Pipeline

Once you've created your pipeline, you'll define the CI workflow using YAML or the visual designer. Below is a basic YAML example for a Pulumi project:

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- script: |
    npm install
    npm test
  displayName: 'Run tests'
```

This pipeline:

- Triggers on every push to the `main` branch.
- Uses an Ubuntu-based agent.
- Installs project dependencies and runs tests using the specified script.

#### 8.2.3 Customize Your Pipeline

You can customize your Azure DevOps pipeline to fit your specific needs. For example, you can add deployment steps to provision your Pulumi infrastructure to Azure after successful tests.

#### 8.2.4 Save and Run

Save your pipeline configuration and trigger a manual or automatic run to start the CI process.

### 8.3 Benefits of CI with Azure DevOps Pipelines

- **Azure Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Azure services for infrastructure deployments.
- **Customization**: Define custom workflows tailored to your project's requirements.
- **Scalability**: Azure DevOps Pipelines can scale to handle complex CI/CD pipelines.
- **Artifact Management**: Easily manage and deploy built artifacts.

### 8.4 Best Practices for CI

Here are some best practices to consider when setting up CI for your Pulumi projects using Azure DevOps Pipelines:

- **Fast Feedback**: Keep your CI builds fast to provide developers with quick feedback on their changes.
- **Parallelization**: Run tests in parallel to save time.
- **Environment Isolation**: Isolate test environments to prevent interference between different tests.
- **Artifact Management**: Use CI to build and store artifacts for deployments.
- **Notifications**: Configure notifications to alert team members of build and test results.

With CI in place using Azure DevOps Pipelines, you can ensure that your Pulumi infrastructure code is continually validated, helping you maintain a reliable and error-free infrastructure.
