# Testing Infrastructure Code

Testing is a crucial part of developing reliable infrastructure code. It helps ensure that your infrastructure deployments are predictable and free from errors. In this section, we'll explore how to set up testing for your Pulumi code using Jest, a widely used JavaScript testing framework.

### 7.1 Why Test Infrastructure Code?

Testing infrastructure code offers several benefits:

- **Reliability**: Tests help ensure that your infrastructure behaves as expected, reducing the risk of unexpected issues in production.
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as documentation for your code, providing clear examples of how it should be used.
- **Regression Prevention**: Tests catch regressions, ensuring that changes to your codebase do not break existing functionality.
- **Confidence**: A comprehensive test suite gives you confidence in the correctness of your infrastructure.

### 7.2 Setting Up Jest for Pulumi

#### Prerequisites

Before setting up Jest for your Pulumi project, make sure you have Jest and any necessary dependencies installed. You can do this by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @pulumi/pulumi @azure/arm-storage
```

#### Writing Tests

Let's create a basic test for a Pulumi resource. Suppose you have a Pulumi program that deploys an Azure Storage Account, and your code looks like this:

```javascript
const pulumi = require("@pulumi/pulumi");
const azure = require("@pulumi/azure");

class MyStorageAccount extends pulumi.ComponentResource {
    constructor(name, opts) {
        super("custom:MyStorageAccount", name, {}, opts);

        const storageAccount = new azure.storage.Account(name, {
            resourceGroupName: opts.resourceGroupName,
            accountReplicationType: "LRS",
            accountTier: "Standard",
        }, { parent: this });

        this.endpoint = storageAccount.primaryBlobEndpoint;
        this.registerOutputs();
    }
}

module.exports = MyStorageAccount;
```

You can write a Jest test for this resource like so:

```javascript
const MyStorageAccount = require("./myStorageAccount");

describe("MyStorageAccount", () => {
    it("creates a storage account with the correct settings", () => {
        const resource = new MyStorageAccount("testStorageAccount", {
            resourceGroupName: "testResourceGroup",
        });
        
        expect(resource.endpoint).toEqual(expect.stringContaining("blob.core.windows.net"));
        // Add more assertions as needed
    });
});
```

This test ensures that your `MyStorageAccount` resource correctly creates an Azure Storage Account with the specified settings.

### 7.3 Running Jest Tests

To run your Jest tests for Pulumi code, you can use the `jest` command:

```bash
npx jest
```

This will execute all the test suites in your project.

### 7.4 Benefits of Testing with Jest

- **Isolation**: Jest allows you to run tests in isolation, ensuring that changes in one part of your infrastructure code do not affect others.
- **Easy Setup**: Setting up Jest for testing Pulumi code is straightforward and doesn't require complex configurations.
- **Continuous Integration**: Jest is commonly used in continuous integration pipelines, allowing you to automate tests when you push changes to your code repository.

### 7.5 Best Practices for Testing Infrastructure as Code

Here are some best practices to consider when testing your infrastructure code:

- **Test All Code Paths**: Ensure that your tests cover various scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions.
- **Use Mocks and Stubs**: Mock external services or dependencies to isolate your tests from the real infrastructure.
- **Automate Testing**: Integrate testing into your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early.
- **Keep Tests Simple**: Write tests that are easy to understand and maintain.
- **Monitor and Review**: Continuously monitor test results and review failing tests promptly.

In the next section, we'll explore continuous integration (CI) to automate testing and deployments in your infrastructure projects.
